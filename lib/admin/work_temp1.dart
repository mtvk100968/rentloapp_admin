// The error indicates that your Firebase project is still on the Spark (free) plan. Some APIs like Cloud Build and Artifact Registry require the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. To deploy functions that depend on these services, you'll need to upgrade your Firebase project.
//
// To upgrade your project:
//
// Open the Firebase Console.
// Select your project (rentloapp-admin).
// Navigate to the "Usage and billing" section.
// Follow the instructions to upgrade to the Blaze plan.
// Once the upgrade is complete, run your deployment command again:
// bash
// Copy
// firebase deploy --only functions
// After upgrading, the required APIs will be enabled and you should be able to deploy your functions successfully.

// If you have any more questions or run into issues, feel free to ask!
